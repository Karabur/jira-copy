# jira-copy
Missing Jira functionality - issue title copy button.


Copy issue title is a long requiested feature in Jira which is missing in Jira and not planned to implement.
It is often required to get full issue name for using it in git commits/comments/mails/etc. 
That extension adds a small copy icon which copies issue ID and Title to clipboard. 


Tested with Jira v7.2.3
